            DriveHub (“we”, “us”) is a demonstration used-car marketplace. This policy explains how
            information is handled. Because this is a front-end-only demo, all data is stored
            locally in your browser and never sent to any server.

        <Section title="How we use information">
          <p>
            In a production build this data would be used to operate listings, process bookings, and
            provide support. In this demo it remains in your browser’s local storage to simulate the
            experience without transmitting anything.
          </p>
        </Section>
        <Section title="Data storage">
          <p>
            Data persists only in your browser under a local storage key. Clearing your browser data
            or using Settings → Reset demo data removes it entirely.

        </Section>
        <Section title="Your rights">
          <p>
            You can view, edit, or delete your information at any time from the Profile and Settings
            pages. You may reset all demo data instantly from Settings.
